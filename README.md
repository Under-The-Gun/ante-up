    #User stories-
    I am just starting out at poker and want a way to see a lot of hands and study the values of winning hands to learn what hands beat other hands so I can eventually take what I have learned and play with my friends and cash games.

    I wanted a place where I can invite my friends to play poker from the convenience of my own house. I can simply invite them to play by entering the npx ante-up package. We can play from wherever my friends live, making it the ultimate "home" game!
